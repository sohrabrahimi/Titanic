# Titanic
In this project I will explore some patterns in the Titanic dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic. The main objective of this piece is to experiment with different functions in python, particularly Numpy and Pandas. In this report, I will present different visualization techniques and in the end, present a classification model.

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* Python 2.7
* NumPy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* iPython Notebook

If you already have Python 2.7 installed on your computer, then you can install NumPy, and iPython Notebook by using pip on the command line. This page may also be of use for some packages for Windows users, if pip has trouble performing the installation. If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.
