# Titanic
In this project I will explore some patterns in the Titanic dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic. The main objective of this piece is to experiment with different functions in python, particularly Numpy and Pandas. In this report, I will present different visualization techniques and in the end, present a classification model.
